				<h1>Welcome To Jain Public School</h1>
				<p> Jain Public School is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. This include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university, but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory. Kindergarten or pre-school provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5).<br>We recognize that all students are uniquely talented. Within our exceptionally supportive community, students develop positive relationships and relish the opportunity to realize their individual potential to the full. Learning at CSS is highly student-centred, engaging and inquiry based. Through a broad range of experiences in and beyond school, students become confident, optimistic, compassionate and internationally-minded young adults, ready to find their place in the world.<br>While encouraging students to strive for academic excellence, they are also guided individually to develop their individual potential and talent to the full. The school encourages students to develop good character and global citizenship through action and service embedded in the rich and multifaceted co-curricular programmes. These characteristics are strongly promoted by the school's 'CSS Learner Attributes'. Students learn to appreciate positive universal human values including responsibility, honesty, integrity, humility, commitment, perseverance, respect for others, compassion and valuing learning.
